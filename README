To generate a random maze using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we will follow the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture. The core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary are as follows:

1. Model:
   - Maze: Represents the maze structure and contains methods for generating the maze.
   - Cell: Represents a single cell in the maze.

2. View:
   - MazeView: Responsible for rendering the maze on the HTML page.

3. Controller:
   - MazeController: Handles user interactions and updates the model and view accordingly.

this is the basic structure of the random maze generator using the MVC architecture. Each file represents a separate component of the architecture, and they are all interconnected to generate and display the maze on the HTML page.

Please note that this is a simplified implementation, and you may need to add more functionality and logic depending on your specific requirements.

## Maze Generation Algorithm

The maze generation algorithm that we will be using is called the Recursive Backtracker. It is a depth-first search algorithm that uses a stack to keep track of the current path. The algorithm works as follows:

1. Choose a random starting cell and mark it as visited.

2. While there are unvisited cells:
   - If the current cell has any unvisited neighbors:
     - Choose a random unvisited neighbor.
     - Push the current cell to the stack.
     - Remove the wall between the current cell and the chosen neighbor.
     - Make the chosen neighbor the current cell and mark it as visited.
   - Else if stack is not empty:
     - Pop a cell from the stack and make it the current cell.

## Limitations

The maze generation algorithm that we have implemented has a few limitations:
1- The maze is not guaranteed to have a solution.
2- The maze is not guaranteed to be perfect (i.e., there may be inaccessible areas).
3- The maze is not guaranteed to be unique (i.e., there may be multiple solutions).
4- For best results, the maze should have an odd number of rows and columns.

## How to run the project

To run the project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. If you donâ€™t have it installed, you can download it from the official website.

Once you have Node.js installed, you can run the following command to install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

After installing the dependencies, you can run the following command to start the server:

```
npm start
```

This will start the server on port 3000. You can then open the following URL in your browser to view the maze:

```
http://localhost:3000
```
